# 🎾 Tennis Tournament API 🚀

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** The API is currently under **active development**!

## 💡 Motivation  
I wanted a better way to stay informed about upcoming tennis tournaments in Germany. The existing platforms, like [tennis.de] and mybigpoint.de, don’t fully meet my expectations.

That’s why I decided to build my own platform—one that includes the features I need, such as:
✅ Tournament notifications 📢
✅ A more user-friendly UI 🎨
✅ Better data accessibility 📊

This API serves as the backbone for future projects, making tournament data easier to retrieve and use! 🚀
