# 🎾 mybigpoint Tournament API 🚀  
This is the **unofficial** API for retrieving relevant tournament data of **tennis tournaments in Germany**.

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** The API is currently under **active development**!  

## 🌍 Supported Associations  
✅ **Currently Supported:**  
- Saxony 🇩🇪  
- Saxony-Anhalt 🇩🇪  
- Thuringia 🇩🇪  

🔜 **More regions will be added in the future!**  

## ⚙️ How It Works

## 📖 How to Use

## 💡 Motivation  
I don’t like the way the **mybigpoint** platform (`tennis.de`) manages **tournament search & display**. 🧐  
There are several missing features I’d love to have, such as:  
- 🔔 **Notifications** when new tournaments are announced  
- 📊 A better way to **scrape & organize** data  
- 🚀 **Improved search functionality**  

Since these features don’t exist, I decided to **build them myself!** 💪  

## 🤝 Contribution  
👨‍💻 **Contributions are welcome!** Feel free to commit & help improve the API. 🚀  

🔹 **How to contribute?**  
1️⃣ Send a **pull request**, and I will review it.  
2️⃣ If the code is solid, it **gets merged!** 🎉  

💡 You can also open an **issue** or suggest new features!
